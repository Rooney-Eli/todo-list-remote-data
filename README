todo-list-remote-data

Description: A simple todo list application written with react-native that allows remote data storage on a web API.

Usage:
    To add a todo item, simply type the todo message into the text field located at the top of the list.

    To remove a todo item, tap the red X icon on the right side of any given todo.

    To join todo items together, long press the list then tap the checkbox of each item you wish to join.
    Once joined, click the join button then exit the long press mode by tapping "cancel" on the top of the app

    To split todo items, simply click the green "Split!" button located on the desired todo item from the list.

    To save the data you have entered for persistent storage, tap "Save" located at the top of the app.

    To load the data you have entered previously, click "Load" located at the top of the app, or just relaunch the app.

Known issues:
    Occasionally when items are split they generate a blank item. Work around: delete the empty item if it is generated.

    Sometimes when the app is loaded the remote data isn't automatically loaded. Work around: manually click "Load" on the homepage
